How are the annotations drawn?
  - How are all the points along the route connected?
    - How to do it in Mapkit?




Code walkthrough and annotation before




Examples of changes to not be so static:


    var eastCoordinates: [CLLocationCoordinate2D]!
    var westCoordinates: [CLLocationCoordinate2D]!
    var lateNightCoordinates: [CLLocationCoordinate2D]!

    - Adjust to use a simple array to store an infinite # of routes
      as retrieved from the datafeed.
      - Use relationa
l array maybe

      var routeLayer is already dynamic, follow how that's set to
        do the coordinate storing


      @IBAction func toggleRoutes(_ sender: UISegmentedControl) {
        switch sender.selectedSegmentIndex {
        case 0:
            showRoute(name: "east")
            showRoute(name: "west")
        case 1:
            showRoute(name: "east")
            hideRoute(name: "west")
        case 2:
            showRoute(name: "west")
            hideRoute(name: "east")
   
     default:
            break
        }
    }

    - Adjust to add an infinite # of buttons for as many routes are
      turned on at the moment
